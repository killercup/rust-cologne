_(The meetup will likely be held in German but we'll switch to English if needed.)_

Dear Rustacean,

join us for our upcoming Rust Meetup on **Wednesday 2024-06-05, 19:15 CEST**.

If you've been waiting to explore Rust, this is your opportunity!
This month's meetup will feature an introductory talk about Rust, showcasing its approach to combining speed with safety, while eliminating many common errors found in other low-level languages.

After that there will be time to answer questions, discuss Rust, or just fetch a drink and mingle.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/301423137/)**.

See you soon!

Yours,
Florian and Kai
