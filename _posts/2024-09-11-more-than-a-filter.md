  abstract: |
    eBPF is a technology that allows small programs to run inside the operating
    system kernel. Common applications are in networking, security, and
    observability. The talk will give a short, general introduction to eBPF and
    then dive into a few concrete examples written in Rust leveraging the
    tooling developed by the Aya project.

Dear Rustacean,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2024-09-11, 19:15 CEST**.

You're new to Rust, tried it out with some private projects or are already working professionally with it for years? You're in good company! Whether you want to speed up your python code, write a web service, need interop with your C++-codebase, cross-compile for a microcontroller, write an emulator, … we've got you covered!

We commonly open up with a brief summary of noteworthy changes in the Rust ecosystem. Be it updates to the language itself, public events, its impact on other projects and languages, …

Then Marc will tell us about [Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF)
and writing them in Rust. These are typically used in networking, security, and observability.

As usual: the remaining time is about whatever _you_ want to talk about!

Always wanted to know why Rust is harder to learn than other popular languages or why it lacks a certain feature? When is it appropriate to rewrite a project in Rust? Is the compiler really that slow and are the binaries really that big? Do all those safety guarantees have an impact on the performance? Fetch a drink and let's find it out.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/303259164)**.

See you soon!

Yours,
Florian and Kai
