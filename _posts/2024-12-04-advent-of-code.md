_(The meetup will likely be held in German but we'll switch to English if needed.)_

Dear Rustacean,

our next monthly Meetup will be on **Wednesday 2024-12-04, 19:15 CEST**.

You're new to Rust, tried it out with some private projects or are already working professionally with it for years? You're in good company! Whether you want to speed up your python code, write a web service, need interop with your C++-codebase, cross-compile for a microcontroller, write an emulator, … we've got you covered!

We open up with a brief summary of noteworthy changes in the Rust ecosystem. Be it updates to the language itself, public events, its impact on other projects and languages, …

After that there will be **Glühwein**! Ah, and we'll have a look at the **[Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/)**. This is expected to be a very beginners-friendly topic and you're invited to compare the solutions in Rust with any other programming language you're familiar with.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/304760521)**.

See you soon!

Yours,
Florian and Kai
