# Invitation draft

Title: This Month in Rust, `{month}`

_(The meetup will likely be held in German but we'll switch to English if needed.)_

Dear Rustacean,

our next Meetup will be on **Wednesday `{YYYY-MM-DD}`, 19:15 CEST**.

You're new to Rust, tried it out with some private projects or are already working professionally with it for years? You're in good company! Whether you want to speed up your python code, write a web service, need interop with your C++-codebase, cross-compile for a microcontroller, write an emulator, … we've got you covered!

We commonly open up with a brief summary of noteworthy changes in the Rust ecosystem. Be it updates to the language itself, public events, its impact on other projects and languages, …

After that we often have volunteers talking about specific topics or personal projects, but in general the remaining time is about whatever _you_ want to talk about!

Always wanted to know why Rust is harder to learn than other popular languages or why it lacks a certain feature? When is it appropriate to rewrite a project in Rust? Is the compiler really that slow and are the binaries really that big? Do all those safety guarantees have an impact on the performance? Fetch a drink and let's find it out.

**[You can register here](https://www.meetup.com/rustcologne/events/####)**.

See you soon!

Yours,
Florian and Kai
